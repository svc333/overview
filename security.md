![ISO 27001/2](images/icon_iso27k1.png)  {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is certified under the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 and 27002 standards**, which define the best practices for information security management processes. ISO 27001 is a widely adopted global security standard that outlines the requirements for information security management systems. It provides a systematic approach to managing company and customer information based on periodic risk assessments. The latest standard, ISO/IEC 27001:2013, was published on September 25, 2013 by the **International Organization of Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)** under the joint ISO and IEC subcommittee. The ISO 27001 standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, and documenting Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) and the requirements for implementing security controls, according to the needs of individual organizations. The ISO 27002 standard explains each security control of ISO 27001 in detail. The ISO 27000 family of standards incorporates a process of scaling risk and valuation of assets, with the goal of safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the written, oral, and electronic information.

To achieve ISO 27001:2013 certification, a company must show that it has a systematic and ongoing approach to managing information security risks that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of company and customer information. This standard emphasizes the measurement and evaluation of how well an organization’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) is performing and also includes information security-related controls that are based on system requirements and other requirements.

![PCI DSS](images/icon_pci.png)  The **Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS)** is an information security standard that is designed to protect credit card data. PCI DSS applies to all entities involved in payment card processing, including merchants, processors, issuers, and service providers. It also applies to all other entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data or sensitive authentication data.

If you store or process credit card data, Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance and network security are of primary concern to your business. To ensure consistent standards for merchants, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council established PCI data security standards. These standards incorporate best practices to protect cardholder data, and they often require validation from a third-party Qualified Service Assessor (QSA). IBM helps customers meet their PCI compliance needs by providing an Attestation on Compliance from an independent QSA. The Attestation on Compliance can be used along with the SOC 2 report and ISO 27001 certification to demonstrate that the infrastructure meets the PCI controls.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} completes an annual PCI DSS assessment by using an approved Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).
