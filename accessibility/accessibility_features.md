There are sub-sections of the user interface that are owned by third party products or services that host content within the platform, for which the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} compliance record does not maintain or own the accessibility compliance status. This means that if you are accessing any user interface or documentation for a service, you must request the compliance statements for that service. For example, if you are using an interface for IBM Containers, the Administration console for a local or dedicated environment, or an IoT service, you must request [product accessibility information ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://able.ibm.com/request/){: new_window} for that interface or documentation.

The {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} documentation accessibility compliance is specifically for the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} core platform information, and it does not extend to any services. From the homepage, the content is separated into tabs, and the Learn section of the Get started tab, Build tab, service-specific CLI docs on the Tools tab, and All docs tab are content that is maintained separately by service teams. The available documentation for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is managed and reported in the IBM Bluemix Continuous Delivery product accessibility information that is available upon request. For compliance status for any service, you must request [product accessibility information ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://able.ibm.com/request/){: new_window}.
